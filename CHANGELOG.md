---

## Breaking Changes

### v0.3.0

1. **Enhanced Error Propagation**
   ```rust
   // OLD (v0.2.x) - Configuration errors could be silently ignored
   let response = client.completions().text_completion(request).await?;
   
   // NEW (v0.3.0+) - Configuration errors are properly propagated
   let response = client.completions().text_completion(request).await?;
   // May now return ConfigError for invalid configurations
   ```

2. **Request Validation**
   ```rust
   // OLD (v0.2.x) - Some invalid requests were sent to API
   let request = CompletionRequest {
       model: "",  // Empty model was accepted
       prompt: "", // Empty prompt was accepted
       ..
   };
   
   // NEW (v0.3.0+) - Invalid requests are caught early
   let request = CompletionRequest {
       model: "",  // Returns ConfigError: "Model ID cannot be empty"
       prompt: "", // Returns ConfigError: "Prompt cannot be empty"
       ..
   };
   ```

3. **Retry Behavior Changes**
   - All endpoints now automatically retry on network failures
   - Retry logging provides more detailed information
   - Jitter adds randomness to retry timing (¬±25%)

### v0.2.0

1. **New API Endpoints**
   - Added Analytics, Providers, Generation, and Credits APIs
   - No breaking changes to existing functionality
   - All existing code continues to work unchanged

2. **Enhanced Type System**
   - More specific error types for new endpoints
   - Enhanced validation for new request types
   - Improved error context and metadata

---

## Migration Guide

### From v0.2.x to v0.3.0

1. **No Code Changes Required** for most users
   - All existing functionality works unchanged
   - Automatic retry behavior improves reliability transparently
   - Enhanced error handling provides better debugging information

2. **Recommended Updates** for enhanced reliability:
   ```rust
   // Monitor retry logs in production
   // Watch for patterns like:
   // "Retrying chat_completion request (1/3) after 625 ms due to status code 429"
   
   // Adjust retry configuration if needed
   let client = OpenRouterClient::from_env()?
       .with_retry_config(RetryConfig {
           max_retries: 5,           // Increase for more resilience
           initial_backoff_ms: 1000,  // Slower initial backoff
           max_backoff_ms: 30000,    // Longer maximum backoff
           retry_on_status_codes: vec![429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
       })?;
   ```

3. **Error Handling Updates**:
   ```rust
   // Enhanced error types provide better context
   match result {
       Err(Error::ContextLengthExceeded { model, message }) => {
           // Handle context limit specifically
       },
       Err(Error::RateLimitExceeded(msg)) => {
           // Automatic retry will handle this, but you may want to log
       },
       // ... other error types
   }
   ```

4. **Testing Updates**:
   - Some tests may need adjustment if they expect specific error messages
   - Retry behavior may affect timing-sensitive tests
   - Consider using `without_retries()` for deterministic testing

### From v0.1.x to v0.2.0

1. **No Breaking Changes** - All existing code continues to work
2. **New APIs Available** - Analytics, Providers, Generation, Credits
3. **Enhanced Documentation** - Updated examples and best practices

---

## Performance Impact

### v0.3.0

- **Retry Overhead**: Minimal impact on successful requests (< 1ms)
- **Memory Usage**: Slight increase for retry state management (< 1KB per request)
- **Network Efficiency**: Reduced overall API calls due to intelligent retries
- **Production Resilience**: Significantly improved reliability under failure conditions

### v0.2.0

- **New API Overhead**: Minimal impact for existing users
- **Caching Benefits**: Provider API caching reduces redundant requests
- **Validation Cost**: Small validation overhead for enhanced reliability

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues After v0.3.0

1. **Unexpected Configuration Errors**
   - **Cause**: Previously suppressed errors now surface properly
   - **Solution**: Fix configuration issues or handle `ConfigError` appropriately

2. **Different Retry Timing**
   - **Cause**: Jitter adds randomness to retry delays
   - **Solution**: This is expected behavior for production resilience

3. **Enhanced Logging Volume**
   - **Cause**: More detailed retry logging
   - **Solution**: Use log filtering or adjust log levels if needed

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Watch Retry Patterns**
   ```bash
   # Monitor retry logs in production
   grep "Retrying" application.log | wc -l
   ```

2. **Track Error Rates**
   - Monitor for increased error rates after upgrade
   - Most errors should be handled automatically by retries

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Track request latency improvements
   - Monitor success rate improvements

---

## Future Roadmap

### v0.4.0 (Planned)

- **Retry-After Header Support**: Respect server-provided retry guidance
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevent cascading failures
- **Retry Budget Management**: Prevent excessive retries in high-throughput scenarios
- **Metrics Integration**: Comprehensive retry metrics collection

### v0.5.0 (Planned)

   // NEW (v0.1.4+) - Still supported, automatically wrapped
   let client = OpenRouterClient::new()
       .with_api_key("sk-key")?;
   
   // NEW - Explicit SecureApiKey usage
   let secure_key = SecureApiKey::new("sk-key")?;
   let client = OpenRouterClient::new()
       .with_secure_api_key(secure_key)?;
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Types**
   - Error messages are now automatically redacted for security
   - More detailed error context and metadata available
   - Some error message formats may have changed

3. **Validation Changes**
   - Stricter API key validation (minimum length, format checks)
   - Enhanced input validation for all request parameters
   - Some previously accepted invalid inputs may now return errors

---

## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.3 to v0.1.4

1. **No code changes required** for most users - the API remains backward compatible
2. **Recommended changes** for enhanced security:
   ```rust
   // Use new convenience constructors
   let client = OpenRouterClient::from_env()?;
   
   // Or for production
   let client = OpenRouterClient::production(
       "sk-key",
       "My App",
       "https://myapp.com"
   )?;
   ```
3. **Test updates** may be needed if you're testing error messages
4. **Environment variables**: Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` or `OR_API_KEY`
