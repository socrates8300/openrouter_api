error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `id`
  --> tests/type_safety/consumed_after_into.rs:19:13
   |
11 |     let id = ModelId::new("test-id");
   |         -- move occurs because `id` has type `ModelId`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
...
14 |     let _s: String = id.into();
   |                         ------ `id` moved due to this method call
...
19 |     let _ = id.as_str();
   |             ^^ value borrowed here after move
   |
note: `into` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `id`
  --> $RUST/core/src/convert/mod.rs
   |
   |     fn into(self) -> T;
   |             ^^^^
help: you can `clone` the value and consume it, but this might not be your desired behavior
   |
14 |     let _s: String = id.clone().into();
